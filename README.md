SkyNet is a project for ComputerCraft: Tweaked that will fluidly integrate turtles on an encrypted, wireless network.

## Farming
SkyNet will be able to allocate X turtles to farm different crops at different GPS regions.
It will also be able to run a tree farm to harvest charcoal.

## Mining
SkyNet will be able to send a scanning turtle, and some digging turtles to a specified minesite to locate ores and return them to the factory.
The scanning turtle will map out ores for turtles to mine, and the central computer will plot out paths and generate instructions for the digging turtles.
This is also where SkyNet will produce most of it's fuel (Harvesting coal)

## Production
SkyNet should be able to produce new turtles for the swarm, location wood (chests), gold, sand (glass), redstone, and other needed components.
